\subsection{RadHard Solar Arrays}
\label{subsec:radhard}
As a secondary mission goal for INSPIRE a cooperation with the european project RadHard which is led by the german solar array manufacturer Azure Space is intended. They are currently developing a new generation of $4$ Juniction solar cells with an efficiency of up to $35 \% $. But the main feature of the new solar arrays is their radiation hardness which will be the highest radiation hardness ever designed with an efficiency of $>3 \% $ after $1E15 \ cm^{-2} \ 1MeV$ electron irradiation. So the Jupiter environment with its extreme radiation would be the best suitable destination for a test and evaulation mission of this new technology. Therefore INSPIRE will be equipped with $8$ RadHard solar cells with a total surface area of $0.0248 m^2$ for a technology demonstration\cite{FraunhoferInstituteforSolarEnergySystemsISE.2021}.
