\chapter{The Mission}
\label{chap:mission}

During the observation  of Jupiter, the Galileo spacecraft performed flybys of the Jupiter moons \cite{Mission_01}.
The scientist gathered data from Europa, which supported the evidence of a thick icy surface.
The possibility of liquid water underneath led astrobiologists to the assumption that extraterrestrial life could exist on Europa \cite{Mission_02}.
That is why Europa is - beside Mars - an interesting object of research.\\

Therefore, ESA will launch the \textit{JUICE} orbiter in 2022 to investigate Europa in more detail \cite{Mission_03}. 
Nevertheless, also NASA is developing the  \textit{Europa Clipper} to get detailed information.
Additionally, they plan a lander for Europa to bring scientific instruments onto the surface \cite{Mission_04, Mission_05}.\\

Under the leadership of  Prof. Dr.-Ing. Klinkner, the Institute of Space Systems, started within a seminar a feasibility study about a rover system to explore Europa surface, which shall  be part of the \textit{TRIPLE} mission.
This challenge was given to five student teams to develop concepts, construct preliminary designs, perform analysis and make evaluations to  meet the mission objectives and fit the mandatory requirements. \\


This report contains the results of the Phase A study of the rover system \textsc{IN-situ Sampling and Primal Investigation Rover on Europa}  (INSPIRE).
