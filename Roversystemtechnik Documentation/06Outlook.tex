\section{Risk Assessment}
\label{sec:RiskAssessment}

To reduce risks and increase the robustness within the development process for the INSPIRE mission, all subsystems focus on flight proven or space grade hard ware. \autoref{tab:SubSys-TRL} provides an overview on the resulting TRL for each subsystem.

Housekeeping electronics and the Boom Mechanism to extend the camera head for the INSPIRE mission will be custom designed components and therefore rated at TRL 0. However due to proven development processes and simple testing the risk for the mission progress is rated non critical.  \\

Payload components development depict the highest risk for the mission. The Analyser for the ice core samples is a downsized replica of the [missing reference]. 
The ice core drill derives from the Nano Drill offered by Honeybee Robotics [Missing reference]. Although the technology is available, the drill has to be adapted and tested. Testing in analog conditions potentially takes place in the arctic region and therefore lengthen the mission development process. \\

As a conclusion the payload subsystem development contains the highest risk for the INSPIRE mission. However the risk is considered manageable. Additionally investing in payload development is regarded worth the risk taking as it is integral to the successful investigation of Europa.
