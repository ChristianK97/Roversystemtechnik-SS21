\subsection{Risk Assessment}

To reduce risks and increase the robustnes within the development process of the INSPIRE mission, all subsystems focus on flight proven or space grade hard ware. \autoref{tab:SubSys-TRL} provides an overview on the TRL of each subsystem.

Housekeeping electronics for the INSPIRE mission will be newly developed and therefore rated as a TRL 0. However due to proven development processes and simple testing the risk for the mission is rated as
